  {"question": "How can I host?", "answer": "To host on MGO1, you'll need to configure port forwarding on your router for any port within the range of 1024 to 65535. \nEnsure that the IP address assigned to the port forwarding rule is approximately 10 digits higher or lower than your IPv4 \naddress to avoid potential conflicts. For instance, if your IPv4 address is 000.000.0.001, the IP address you'd provide \nfor hosting would be something like 000.000.0.011. However, it's important to note that the specifics of port forwarding \ncan vary depending on your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and unfortunately, we're unable to provide direct assistance \nin this matter due to the unique configurations handled by each ISP."},
  {"question": "Why isn't anyone online?", "answer": "The online activity in MGO1 may appear low due to its smaller player base compared to MGO2. Typically, players log on when \nthey know others are online, resulting in intermittent activity. To facilitate a game, it's recommended to utilize the SaveMGO \nDiscord server and @ mention the MGO1 role (@MGO1) to notify others of your interest in playing, thus increasing the chances \nof assembling a group for gameplay."},
  {"question": "How do I make an account?", "answer": "To create an account in MGO1, the process is handled entirely within the game itself, unlike MGO2 which uses an external site. \nFirstly, navigate to the \"Play using detailed settings\" menu within the game. Next, connect to the network and select \n\"Choose from Account list.\" Within this menu, select an available blank player slot and proceed to create your account as \nyou would normally."},
  {"question": "Why do I fail the UDP check when connecting to the server?", "answer": "Failing the UDP check when connecting to the server is a common issue encountered by players on MGO1, attributed to various \nfactors. The primary reasons include incorrect port forwarding, failure to connect to the SaveMGO DNS (142.171.43.167), or \ncongestion on your network. Troubleshooting these issues is recommended, and if unsuccessful, contacting staff through the ticket \nsystem for further assistance is advised."},
  {"question": "Why do I fail the DNAS check when connecting to the server?", "answer": "Failing the DNAS check when connecting to the server is attributed to the absence of Sony's anti-cheat system for online PS2 games, \nwhich has been taken offline. To bypass this check, cheats can be downloaded from our website (https://mgo1.savemgo.com/cheats). \nOn PCSX2, these cheats should be placed in the emulator's cheats folder. On the PS2 console, these cheats can be loaded using \neither a cheat disc or through a mod such as FreeMCboot. This process allows players to bypass the DNAS check and access the \nserver successfully."},
  {"question": "How do I aim?", "answer": "Aiming in MGO1 differs significantly from MGO2, as it follows the Metal Gear Solid 3 control scheme, which heavily relies on the \npressure-sensitive buttons of the DualShock 2 controller. Lightly pressing the Square button raises the player's gun without firing \nallowing the player to enter first person view and line up the gun with your target, enabling precise aiming before shooting, while \npressing the button firmly fires the gun. However, most modern controllers lack pressure sensitivity, making aiming more challenging \nas they register the button press as hard by default. We recommend players either acquire a controller with pressure sensitivity \n(such as a offically made DualShock 3, although they are scarce nowadays) or compensate for the lack of pressure sensitivity through \nextensive practice to improve their aiming accuracy."},
  {"question": "Where can I learn the basics?", "answer": "For those seeking to learn the basics of MGO1, a valuable resource is the collection of guides available on the website \n(https://mgo1.savemgo.com/guides) under the gameplay guides section. These guides offer insightful tips and tricks \nsuitable for both new and returning players. However, it's important to emphasize that practice is indispensable for \nskill development. Regular gameplay sessions are essential for honing one's abilities and improving overall proficiency in the game."}
